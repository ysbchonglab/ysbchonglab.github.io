##Abstract

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) display a complex blood transcriptome whose cellular origin is poorly resolved.
Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled ~276,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 33 children with SLE with different degrees
of disease activity and 11 matched controls. Increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) distinguished cells from children with SLE
from healthy control cells. The high ISG expression signature (ISGhi) derived from a small number of transcriptionally defined subpopulations
within major cell types, including monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells,
conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, B cells and especially plasma cells. Expansion of unique subpopulations
enriched in ISGs and/or in monogenic lupus-associated genes classified patients with the highest disease activity.
Profiling of ~82,000 single peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adults with SLE confirmed the expansion of similar subpopulations
in patients with the highest disease activity. This study lays the groundwork for resolving the origin of the SLE transcriptional signatures
and the disease heterogeneity towards precision medicine applications.

##Abstract
Emerging evidence supports that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis.
Here we show that programmed mitochondrial removal, a hallmark of mammalian erythropoiesis, is defective in SLE. Specifically,
we demonstrate that during human erythroid cell maturation, a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated metabolic switch is responsible
for the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which precedes and is necessary for the autophagic removal of mitochondria.
A defect in this pathway leads to accumulation of red blood cells (RBCs) carrying mitochondria (Mito+ RBCs) in SLE patients and in correlation
with disease activity. Antibody-mediated internalization of Mito+ RBCs induces type I interferon (IFN) production through activation
of cGAS in macrophages. Accordingly, SLE patients carrying both Mito+ RBCs and opsonizing antibodies display the highest levels of blood
IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signatures, a distinctive feature of SLE.

##Abstract

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by loss of tolerance to nucleic acids and highly diverse clinical
manifestations. To assess its molecular heterogeneity, we longitudinally profiled the blood transcriptome of 158 pediatric patients.
Using mixed models accounting for repeated measurements, demographics, treatment, disease activity (DA), and nephritis class, we confirmed
a prevalent IFN signature and identified a plasmablast signature as the most robust biomarker of DA. We detected gradual enrichment of neutrophil 
transcripts during progression to active nephritis and distinct signatures in response to treatment in different nephritis subclasses. 
Importantly, personalized immunomonitoring uncovered individual correlates of disease activity that enabled patient stratification into seven groups,
supported by patient genotypes. Our study uncovers the molecular heterogeneity of SLE and provides an explanation for the failure of clinical trials.
This approach may improve trial design and implementation of tailored therapies in genetically and clinically complex autoimmune diseases.
